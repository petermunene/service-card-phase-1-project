Hotels often rely on phone calls or in-person visits to the reception for service requests, which can be inconvenient and time-consuming for guests. To enhance the guest experience, I developed a Hotel Services Request Website—a digital platform where clients can effortlessly browse available services and request them without needing to call reception.

This system improves efficiency, reduces staff workload, and provides a seamless, modern experience for hotel guests. With just a few clicks, they can order room service, request housekeeping, or schedule maintenance, all from their device.
